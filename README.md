MiP RobotHacker
===============

The MiP BLE protocol lets you send and receive commands to and from your [MiP robot](http://www.meetmip.com). You will need to write your own control code in the language of your choice.

Pre-built SDKs are available for iOS: https://github.com/WowWeeLabs/MiP-iOS-SDK

For information on WowWee products visit: http://www.wowwee.com/.

How to use it
-----------------------------------------------
*Finding a MiP before Connecting*
To know the difference between MiP and other BLE based products you can check the *Manufactorer Specific Data* which is sent as part of the advertising Packet. Check with your BLE framework on how to get this.

Each WowWee BLE product assigns a special 16bit ID in the first two bytes of the Manufactorer specific data. If you are using one of our prebuilt SDKs this is handled automatically for you.

*Controlling a MiP*
Bluetooth Low Energy is made up of a series of Services & Characteristics. In the case of MiP these are proprietary which means you need to find them by UUID. The following important services are available:

路  Receive Data Service: 0xFFE0
路  Send Data Service: 0xFFE5

Within each of these services there are some Characteristics available. Characteristics determine how to use the service, in the case of MiP these are very simple:

*路  Receive Data Service*
  Receive Data NOTIFY Characteristic: 0xFFE4
*路  Send Data Service*
  Send Data WRITE Characteristic: 0xFFE5
  
Using your Bluetooth Framework of choice you can choose to run a callback everytime you receive data using the Receive Data NOTIFY Characteristic.
